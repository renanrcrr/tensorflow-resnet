# Neural network architecture with ResNet (Residual Network)

This code demonstrates building a deep ResNet model with several residual blocks of varying depths. 

## Installation

pip install tensorflow

The architecture is complex, and it provides better performance on image classification tasks. 

It's worth noting that implementing and training such complex models requires careful consideration of hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and access to computational resources.
